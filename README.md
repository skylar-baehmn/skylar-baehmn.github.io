UPCOMING FEATURES:
  - make and commit art to imporove the website. Currently all CSS is temporary until I can finish the art specifically designed for the website.
  - add a new game - guess the controversy. The user will be given a controversy and made to guess the person whose actions it details
  - add to form game - I am working with a few ideas about how to add more form requirements (email, captcha, etc.)
  - add mobile support. With what is on the website currently, mobile users will not be able to complete the form game. This is an issue with the game itself not being possible on mobile
    (ex. the tracing name confirmation did not work when testing with the touch commands from a mobile device.) I will be looking into making mobile work, or redesigning some of the challenges
    so that they work on a mobile device (but this is low on the list of priorities).
